## About Me

I’m **Giuseppe Messina**, a full-stack TypeScript developer with a strong **frontend focus** and over **eight years of professional experience** building accessible, performant, and maintainable web applications.

React and TypeScript are where I’m strongest, but I also have hands-on backend experience through personal full-stack projects using **Node, Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Prisma**, and real-time features like **Socket.IO**.

My commercial background spans **design systems**, **UI architecture**, **component libraries**, **accessibility**, **performance optimisation**, and cross-team collaboration. I’ve worked across SaaS, accessibility tech, AI-driven platforms, CRO, and large multi-department organisations, always aiming for clean abstractions, reusable components, and predictable interfaces.

Outside of work, my GitHub and personal site act as an evolving lab of experiments, micro-demos, full applications, and deeper explorations into React, TypeScript, animations, design systems, real-time features, and backend services. I’m always learning, improving, and pushing myself to build better.

I’m driven by creating products that **look clean**, **feel great to use**, and **scale well**, whether that’s a polished UI, a structured API, or an entire application from scratch.
